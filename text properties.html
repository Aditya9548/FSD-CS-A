    <p>
        Satoru Gojo is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar Curse, helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series.

    <h2>Creation and conception</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Gege Akutami created Satoru Gojo with the idea of being one of the strongest characters in the entire series, but at the same time being easy to understand to the readers. One of Gojo's key ideas for his design is a blindfold he wears, in which he can still see with thanks to his supernatural powers. His eyes, the 6 Eyes, were primarily used to encounter Curses. In his debut in Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Akutami linked Gojo and Yuta Okkotsu to Michizane Sugawara, a famous figure in Japanese history, to explain from whom both characters inherited their supernatural powers. This was done as a tribute to his late editor, Yamanaka. Gojo's design is intended to be the one of a handsome man, often called bishonen.His facial design was inspired by a minor Naruto character whose face was covered in bandages.

        Comic Book Resources regarded Gojo as the 9th most mature character in the series despite his childish personality which is why they found the character highly lovable within the manga's readers. In another article, the same site regarded him as one of the series' most dangerous members due to his over-the-top powers that cannot be rivaled by anyone else in the manga. IGN also called Gojo as a fan-favorite character due to the focus of his personality.
